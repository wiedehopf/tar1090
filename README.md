## NO WARRANTY

See the bottom of this page or the LICENSE for details.
While striving not to disrupt an existing Raspbian / Debian / Ubuntu installation, this can't be guaranteed.
This install script assumes Raspbian / Debian / Ubunutu and will not work on systems without apt.

tar1090 is not a readsb / dump1090-fa replacement, it merely adds an additional webinterface for an existing readsb or dump1090-fa installation.
dump1090-mutability installations should work as well, aircraft details will be limited though.

## Installation

```
sudo bash -c "$(wget -nv -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiedehopf/tar1090/master/install.sh)"
```

## View the added webinterface

Click the following URL and replace the IP address with address of your Raspberry Pi:

http://192.168.x.yy/tar1090

Check further down or keyboard shortcuts.

## Update (same command as installation)

```
sudo bash -c "$(wget -q -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiedehopf/tar1090/master/install.sh)"
```

Configuration should be preserved.


## Configuration (optional):

Edit the configuration file to change the interval in seconds and number of history files saved:
```
sudo nano /etc/default/tar1090
```
Ctrl-x to exit, y (yes) and enter to save.

Apply the configuration:
```
sudo systemctl restart tar1090
```

The duration of the history in seconds can be calculated as interval times history_size.

## Configuring the web interface (optional):

Remove the // at the start of a line, otherwise the setting will not be used.

```
sudo nano /usr/local/share/tar1090/html/config.js
```

Ctrl-x to exit, y (yes) and enter to save.
Then Ctrl-F5 to refresh the web interface in the browser.

If you somehow broke the interface or want the default config back:
```
sudo rm /usr/local/share/tar1090/html/config.js
```
Then run the install script again.


## Change Log

The commit log on the github page is the only form of change log.
If you can't find the commit log or don't understand what it means, you have 3 options:
- Assume there is no update and use the currently installed version.
- Run the update script as provided above and let it surprise you!
- Complain about the lack of a change log and be mocked.

While i make this interface available for others to install and hope you like it,
i maintain this interface mainly for users who are curious and can figure it out themselves.
Documentation and explanation is time consuming to do and as such i choose to limit it to the essential.

## Reporting a bug

If you think you have found a bug, open an issue here on github.
Please check all the buttons and read all the tooltips before you do.
Try deleting the browser cache for the tar1090 page.


## Enable (/disable) FA links in the webinterface (previously enabled by default)

```
# ENABLE:
sudo sed -i -e 's?.*flightawareLinks.*?flightawareLinks = true;?' /usr/local/share/tar1090/html/config.js
# ENABLE if the above doesn't work (updated from previous version)
echo 'flightawareLinks = true;' | sudo tee -a /usr/local/share/tar1090/html/config.js
# DISABLE:
sudo sed -i -e 's?.*flightawareLinks.*?flightawareLinks = false;?' /usr/local/share/tar1090/html/config.js
```

Then Ctrl-F5 to refresh the web interface in the browser.

## UAT receiver running dump978-fa and skyaware978:

This is the relevant part in the configuration file:
```
# Change to yes to enable UAT/978 display in tar1090
ENABLE_978=no
# If running dump978-fa on another computer, modify the IP-address as appropriate.
URL_978="http://127.0.0.1/skyaware978"
```
Open and save as described above in the Configuration section.
Follow the instructions in the file.

### UAT only configuration

tar1090 running on the same pi as the skyaware978/dump978-fa:

```
echo /run/skyaware978 tar1090 | sudo tee /etc/default/tar1090_instances
```

After that run the install script and it should work.
978 should be disabled in the config file for this configuration.
UAT traffic will be displayed as ADS-B, this can't be avoided.

### Installation / Update to work with another folder, for example /run/combine1090


```
wget -q -O /tmp/install.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiedehopf/tar1090/master/install.sh
sudo bash /tmp/install.sh /run/combine1090
```

## Remove / Uninstall

```
sudo bash -c "$(wget -q -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiedehopf/tar1090/master/uninstall.sh)"
```

## Keyboard Shortcuts


- Q and E zoom out and in.
- A and D move West and East.
- W and S move North and South.
- C or Esc clears the selection.
- M toggles multiselect.
- T selects all aircraft
- B toggle map brightness

## Multiple instances

The script can install multiple instances, this is accomplished by first editing `/etc/default/tar1090_instances`:

On each line there must be one instance.
First on the line the source directory where the aircraft.json is located.
Second on the line the name where you want to access the according website.
(http://pi/tar1090 or http://pi/combo or http://pi/978 in this example)

If you want the instance at http://pi/, use webroot as a name.

The main instance needs to be included in this file.

Example file:
```
/run/dump1090-fa tar1090
/run/combine1090 combo
/run/skyaware978 978
/run/dump1090-fa webroot
```

After saving that file, just run the install script and it will install/update
all instances.

Configuration for each instance will be separate, in the example the config files would be:
```
/etc/default/tar1090
/etc/default/tar1090-combo
/etc/default/tar1090-978
/etc/default/tar1090-webroot
```

HTML folders will be:
```
/usr/local/share/tar1090/html
/usr/local/share/tar1090/html-combo
/usr/local/share/tar1090/html-978
/usr/local/share/tar1090/html-webroot
```

The run folder and systemd service will be called tar1090-combo and tar1090-978
in this example file.
The main instance is the exception to that rule, having systemd service and run
directory called just tar1090.

### Removing an instance

For example removing the instance with the name combo and 978:

First remove the corresponding line from `/etc/default/tar1090_instances` and
save the file so when you update it doesn't get installed again.

Then run the following command adapted to your instance name, you'll need to
include the tar1090- which is automatically added for the service names:

```
sudo bash /usr/local/share/tar1090/uninstall.sh tar1090-combo
sudo bash /usr/local/share/tar1090/uninstall.sh tar1090-978
```

If the instance was installed with the old method without the tar1090_instances
file, you'll have to try without the tar1090- before the combo, like this:

```
sudo bash /usr/local/share/tar1090/uninstall.sh combo
sudo bash /usr/local/share/tar1090/uninstall.sh 978
```

## lighttpd

tar1090 is now available at :8504 by default when using lighttpd. (port 8504)

To display tar1090 at /, add an instance as described above that has the name webroot.
It will be available at /



## nginx configuration

If nginx is installed, the install script should give you a configuration file
you can include.  The configuration needs to go into the appropriate server { }
section.

## heywhatsthat.com range outline:

- Create a panorama on http://www.heywhatsthat.com/
- You an use up in the air on the map and set altitudes to view the outlines
- For use on the tar1090 map the altitude will be set by changing the download URL
- Near the top of the page, an URL for the panorama is mentioned.
- Replace teh XXXXXX in the following command with the ID contained in your panorama URL
```
sudo wget -O /usr/local/share/tar1090/html/upintheair.json "http://www.heywhatsthat.com/api/upintheair.json?id=XXXXXXXX&refraction=0.25&alts=12192"
```
- You should now have a range outline for the theoretical range for aircraft at 40000 ft on your tar1090 map



## A separate instance with longer data retention for gauging range

```
sudo nano /etc/default/tar1090_instances
```

put in these two lines if you're using readsb
```
/run/readsb tar1090
/run/readsb persist
```

put in these two lines if you're using dump1090-fa
```
/run/dump1090-fa tar1090
/run/dump1090-fa persist
```

if you then run the tar1090 install script afterwards you'll have an extra instance you can configure the history retention for.
```
sudo bash -c "$(wget -q -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiedehopf/tar1090/master/install.sh)"
sudo nano /etc/default/tar1090-persist
```

change to these values for 24h of history:

```
# Interval at which the track history is saved
INTERVAL=20
# How many points in time are stored in the track history
HISTORY_SIZE=4300
```

then
```
sudo systemctl restart tar1090-persist
```
and the persist instance will start saving more data.
You can then visit `/persist/?pTracks` instead of `/tar1090` to get the complete 24h history displayed.
Press T to toggle the traces on and off, this is recommended for zooming and panning as with the traces showing this can be slow.

(you can also look at /tar1090/?pTracks if you want to look only at the more recent tracks, interval / history can be configured in /etc/tar1090 for that instance)

For adding the range outline to the /persist instance after having used the method described earlier, copy over the json:

```
sudo cp /usr/local/share/tar1090/html/upintheair.json /usr/local/share/tar1090/html-persist
```


## 0800-DESTROY-SD-CARD

History function as used for tar1090.adsbexchange.com

No seriously this writes to disk quite often, it will fill up your sd-card by means of writing lots of little files.

This is not in any way or form officially supported and you should consider it experimental.
To accomplish this, you need to use the dev branch of my readsb repository.
(https://github.com/wiedehopf/adsb-wiki/wiki/Building-readsb-from-source#wiedehopfs-dev-branch)

The following options need to be added to for example the decoder options in `/etc/default/readsb`
```
--write-json-globe-index --write-globe-history /var/globe_history --heatmap 30
```
/var/globe_history needs to be a direcotry writeable by the user readsb.
`sudo mkdir /var/globe_history` and `sudo chown readsb /var/globe_history` are useful for that.

You will also need to point tar1090 to /run/readsb in case you are using another dump1090/readsb.
See the "multiple instances" readme section.

If you don't want readsb to read data from the SDR, you'll also need to change the receiver options line to something like this:
```
RECEIVER_OPTIONS="--net-only --net-connector 192.168.2.7,30005,beast_in"
```
If you have another dump1090/readsb running on the same machine, you'll also need to change all the ports to avoid conflicts.

This will obviously write data to the hard drive, be aware of that.
The data format is subject to change, don't expect this to be stable.
Be aware of that when upgrading either tar1090 or readsb to a new commit.

For these features i only maintain the nginx configuration, not the lighttpd configuration.
Thus you'll need to use nginx with the config file provided by the tar1090 install script
or change the lighttpd configuration yourself.
On the default nginx install you'll usually find the server section in this config file:
`/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default`

If you can't figure out how to make it work with the above information, please don't ask.
I don't support this feature for the general user base.
This information is only for people who could figure it out from the source code anyhow,
so that they don't have to spend as much time figuring it out.

## history not loading issue (possible fix)

For a day or so i had a bug in the install script turning symbolic links in /etc/lighttpd/conf-enabled into copies of the files they were pointing to.

This can cause some other issues with my install script which fiddles with the lighttpd config files to make mod_setenv work.

Anyhow if just rerunning the install script does not fix your history loading issue, you can try this:

```
cd /etc/lighttpd/conf-enabled
for i in *; do if [ -f "../conf-available/$i" ]; then sudo ln -s -f "../conf-available/$i" $i; fi; done
```

After that rerun the install script.
If you still have history loading issues, get back to me via the github issues or the various forums i frequent.
